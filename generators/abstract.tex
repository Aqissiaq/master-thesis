In this thesis we consider theoretical models of version control systems based
on Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). The main contribution is an implementation of Angiuli
et al.'s Homotopical Patch Theory~\cite{Angiuli2016} in Cubical Agda.

Additionally we survey other approaches including Darcs' ``patch algebra'' [AND
CATEGORICAL?], and (unsuccessfully) propose an approach based on type-theoretic
coequalizers.

Finally, the first chapter contains an approachable introduction to HoTT and
(Cubical) Agda aimed at an audience of interested computer science students.
