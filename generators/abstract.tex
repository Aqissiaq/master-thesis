In this thesis we consider theoretical models of version control systems based
on Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). The main contribution is an implementation of Angiuli
et al.'s Homotopical Patch Theory~\cite{Angiuli2016} in Cubical
Agda\footnote{Available at \url{https://github.com/Aqissiaq/hpt-experiments}.}.

Additionally the first chapter contains an approachable introduction to HoTT and
Cubical Agda aimed at an audience of interested computer science students
covering dependent Martin-L\"of-style type theory, propositions as types,
univalent foundations, higher inductive types and and CCHM cubical type theory.

Finally, we discuss some other approaches to a theory of version control systems
in Darcs' ``algebra of patches'' and an unsuccessful attempt to model
repositories in type theory as coequalizers.
