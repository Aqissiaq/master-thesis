\section{Our idea [BETTER TITLE?]}

This section introduces the problems with current approaches and the idea of our
proposed solution.

Basically:
\begin{enumerate}
\item requirements
  \begin{itemize}
  \item repo - accurately represents contents
  \item patch - applicable in a context, groupoid structure
  \item merge - ``pushout property''/reconcile, symmetric (for distributed
    systems), (do we need associativity as well?)
  \end{itemize}
\item hopes/goals
  \begin{itemize}
  \item repos - modular/composable, somehow polymorphic
  \item patches - \emph{semantic} in some sense
  \item merge - easily definable [sic.], considers semantics of patches
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
