\section{Background}

This section introduces the terminology and overall structure of version control
systems for use in the ensuing work.

At the very least we need to define:
\begin{itemize}
  \item repository
  \item patch
  \item merge
\end{itemize}

Might also be nice:
\begin{itemize}
  \item branch?
  \item cherry pick?
\end{itemize}
