\section{Higher Inductive Types}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item inductive types: base case(s) and point generator(s)
  \item example: $A + B, \mathbb{N}$
  \item HIGHER inductive types: terms and identities
  \item ie. points and paths between points (and paths between paths (and
    paths between paths between paths))
  \item elimination rules? they need to go somewhere, but this might not be it
\end{enumerate}
