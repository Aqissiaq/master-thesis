\section{Spaces as Types}\label{sec:spaces}

Another (related) way to make sense of identity types is through homotopy theory. With
this interpretation pioneered by Voevodsky~\cite{voevodsky2014} and the HoTT
program~\cite{hottbook}, a term of $x =_A y$ is like a path in $A$ from $x$ to
$y$.
In fact the collection of all such paths is itself a space (and thus a type):
the path space. Additionally there may be paths between paths, paths between
paths between paths and so on. These higher paths are the eponymous
``homotopies'' and provide a rich field of study on their own.
Geometrically we visualize them as ``filling in'' the space between paths.
