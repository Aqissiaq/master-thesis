\section{Spaces as Types}\label{sec:spaces}
Another important model of types are as spaces. Pioneered by Voevodsky
[CITATION? Mention the book?], his model views types as topological spaces and
terms as points in those spaces. This view sheds a new light on identity types.
A term in $x \equiv_A y$  is a path from $x$ to $y$ and the identity type is
path space. Higher identity types also gain new meaning: paths between two
paths are precisely the eponymous ``homotopies''! Geometrically we visualize
them as ``filling in'' the space between paths.
