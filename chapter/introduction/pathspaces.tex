\subsection{Path Spaces of Higher Inductive Types}
Path Spaces of Higher Inductive Types in Homotopy Type
Theory~\cite{kraus2019path} provides an induction principle for paths in
coequalizers. This is extremely useful, since we want to define functions out of
spans in HITs. ($\leftarrow$ rework this sentence)

Summarizing this will be very technical, and may become its own chapter if I
successfully formalize the proof in cubical agda. Otherwise it goes here.
