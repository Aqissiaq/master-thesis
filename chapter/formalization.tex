This section describes the development of a formalization of Homotopical Patch
theory~\cite{Angiuli2016} in Cubical Agda. First the implementation details of
three [TWO?] patch theories, then some computational results.

We show that the elementary patch theory performs as expected, but that ``a
patch theory with laws'' and ``a patch theory with richer contexts'' require
further development of type-checking tools to fully explore.

These limitations are known challenges. Of particular note is the Brunerie
number~[CITATION] and the ``little Brunerie number''~[CITATION].
