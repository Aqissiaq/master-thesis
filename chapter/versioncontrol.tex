Version control systems are ubiquitous in software development, where they
help facilitate cooperation and documentation of
the development process. Their basic use is to record (\emph{commit}) changes
to a codebase (\emph{repository}). Systems may also include ways for the
codebase to diverge (\emph{branch}) into different versions, and ways to
reunite (\emph{merge}) these versions.
