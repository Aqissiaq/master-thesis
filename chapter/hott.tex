\chapter{Homotopy Type Theory}
It's cool.~\cite{hottbook}

The purpose of this section is to give the reader enough prerequisites to follow the
ensuing development [pretentious af]. It follows, with numerous omissions, the
development in Egbert Rijke's 2019 summer school~\cite{Rijke2019}.
For a more thorough treatment see \autocite{Rijke2012} and for a complete
textbook see The Book~\cite{hottbook}.
